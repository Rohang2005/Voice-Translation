The problem statement adressed in this project is the growing language barrier across the globe. The programming of the project starts with taking an input from the user in the form of an audio input, the second part of the program involves transcribing the the speech into text which can be then translated in the next statement block.Finally, the translated text is converted to audio in the form of an mp3 audio file and the output is given.
