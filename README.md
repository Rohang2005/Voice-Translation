This Project is used to translate audio input from a language to the language it is to be converted to. It can be used to counter the difficulties of a language barrier and model issues in communicating with people residing in other parts of the world.The project is made using python libraries such as deeptranslator, speech recognition, os, pyttsx3, lang detect and gtts. The problem statement adressed in this project is the growing language barrier across the globe. The programming of the project starts with taking an input from the user in the form of an audio input, the second part of the program involves transcribing the the speech into text which then auto detects the language in which the speech has been spoken and asks the user for verification of the detected language. If the user enters yes then the program carries on and the user has to only enter the target language but if the user enters no, the user will have to enter the source language as well as the target language. Finally the text is converted to the target language and converted to audio in the form of an mp3 file and an output is given.
